## 📖 About the Project  

Hi there! 👋 Welcome to my **E-Commerce Sales Data Analysis Project**, built entirely in **Python (Jupyter Notebook)**.  

This is my first complete **data analytics project**, where I explored sales and profit data from an online store to uncover actionable business insights.  

The goal was to understand **monthly sales performance**, **category-wise trends**, and **customer segment behavior** using Python and data visualization techniques.  

---

### 📊 Dataset Columns  
`Order Date`, `Category`, `Sub-Category`, `Sales`, `Profit`, `Quantity`, `Customer Segment`  

*(Dataset inspired by a typical Superstore/E-commerce dataset.)*  

---

## ⚙️ Steps I Followed  

### 🧹 1. Data Loading and Cleaning  
- Imported dataset using **pandas**  
- Checked for missing values and corrected data types  
- Converted `Order Date` into datetime format  
- Removed outliers and invalid entries  

### 📆 2. Monthly Sales Analysis  
- Calculated **total sales per month**  
- Identified **months with highest and lowest sales**  
- Visualized sales trends using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**  

### 🛍️ 3. Category & Sub-Category Analysis  
- Grouped data by **Category** and **Sub-Category**  
- Found which category and sub-category had **highest and lowest sales**  
- Created **bar charts** and **pie charts** for visualization  

### 💰 4. Profit Analysis  
- Calculated **monthly profit**  
- Identified the **most profitable month**  
- Compared **sales and profit trends** across months  

### 👥 5. Customer Segment Analysis  
- Analyzed **sales and profit contribution by customer segment**  
- Determined which segment generated the most revenue and profit  

### ⚖️ 6. Sales-to-Profit Ratio  
- Computed **Sales-to-Profit ratio** for efficiency analysis  
- Helped evaluate overall business profitability  

### 📈 7. Visualization and Reporting  
- Used **Seaborn** for elegant charts  
- Designed **comparative graphs** to highlight key trends  
- Summarized insights for business decision-making
