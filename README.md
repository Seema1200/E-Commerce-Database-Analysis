🛍️ E-Commerce Sales Analysis

Hi, I’m Seema Kumari, an aspiring Data Analyst who enjoys exploring data to uncover meaningful business insights.
This project focuses on analyzing E-Commerce sales data to identify key patterns in sales, profit, categories, and customer segments, helping to understand what drives performance and where improvement is needed.

🎯 Project Objective

The main goal of this project is to analyze E-Commerce sales and profit data to uncover key business insights and answer questions such as:

📅 Which month has the highest and lowest sales and profit?

🏷️ Which product categories generate the most sales and profit?

📦 Which sub-categories perform best and contribute the most to profit?

👥 Which customer segment is the most profitable — Consumer, Corporate, or Home Office?

⚖️ What is the relationship between sales and profit across different months?

💰 How does the sales-to-profit ratio vary by category and over time?

🧭 Which areas of the business should focus on improvement or promotion to increase profit?

I used Python in Jupyter Notebook to clean, explore, and visualize the data, and present insights that could support data-driven decisions.

⚙️ Tools & Libraries

Python 🐍

Jupyter Notebook

pandas – data cleaning and manipulation

numpy – numerical computation

matplotlib & seaborn – data visualization

plotly – interactive charts and dashboards

🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation

Removed missing values and duplicates

Corrected data types (converted “Order Date” to datetime)

Created new columns for Month and Year

Grouped and aggregated data for time-based and category-wise analysis

Filtered outliers to ensure clean visuals and reliable insights

📈 Data Analysis & Key Findings
🗓️ Monthly Sales and Profit

Highest Sales Month: November

Lowest Sales Month: February

Highest Profit Month: December

📊 Insight: Sales and profit increase toward the end of the year, possibly due to seasonal promotions or festive demand.

🏷️ Category Analysis

Top Category (Sales & Profit): Technology

Lowest Category (Sales): Office Supplies

💡 Insight: Technology products bring in the most revenue and profit, while Office Supplies have thinner margins and need improvement strategies.

📦 Sub-Category Analysis

Highest Sales Sub-Category: Chairs

Highest Profit Sub-Category: Copiers

🧠 Insight: Copiers and Chairs drive strong business performance and should be prioritized in marketing and inventory planning.

👥 Customer Segment Analysis

Most Profitable Segment: Consumer

📈 Insight: The Consumer segment contributes the highest revenue and profit, showing that individual buyers are the company’s strongest customer base.

⚖️ Sales-to-Profit Ratio

Overall, the company maintains a healthy sales-to-profit ratio.
However, certain sub-categories under Office Supplies show room for improvement in pricing or sales strategy.

💡 Business Insights

November recorded the highest sales, while December delivered the highest profit.

Technology products lead both sales and profit, proving to be the most lucrative category.

Copiers and Chairs are high-performing sub-categories.

Consumer customers contribute the most to revenue and profitability.

Office Supplies need better marketing or pricing to boost profitability.
