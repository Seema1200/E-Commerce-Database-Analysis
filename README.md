🛍️ E-Commerce Sales Analysis

Hi, I’m Seema Kumari, an aspiring Data Analyst passionate about exploring data to uncover business insights.
This project focuses on analyzing an E-Commerce sales dataset to understand sales and profit trends across months, product categories, and customer segments.

🎯 Project Objective

The main goal of this project is to analyze E-Commerce sales and profit data to uncover key business insights and answer important questions such as:

📅 Which month has the highest and lowest sales and profit?

🏷️ Which product categories generate the most sales and profit?

📦 Which sub-categories perform best and contribute the most to profit?

👥 Which customer segment is the most profitable — Consumer, Corporate, or Home Office?

⚖️ What is the relationship between sales and profit across different months?

💰 How does the sales-to-profit ratio vary by category and over time?

🧭 Which areas of the business should focus on improvement or promotion to increase profit?

I used Python and Jupyter Notebook to clean, explore, and visualize the data, and to present insights that could support data-driven business decisions.
