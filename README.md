🛍️ E-Commerce Sales Analysis

Hi, I’m Seema Kumari
 — an aspiring Data Analyst who enjoys exploring data to uncover meaningful business insights.
This project focuses on analyzing E-Commerce sales data to identify key patterns in sales, profit, categories, and customer segments, helping to understand what drives performance and where improvement is needed.

🎯 Project Objective

The main goal of this project is to analyze E-Commerce sales and profit data to uncover key business insights and answer questions such as:

📅 Which month has the highest and lowest sales and profit?

🏷️ Which product categories generate the most sales and profit?

📦 Which sub-categories perform best and contribute the most to profit?

👥 Which customer segment is the most profitable — Consumer, Corporate, or Home Office?

⚖️ What is the relationship between sales and profit across different months?

💰 How does the sales-to-profit ratio vary by category and over time?

🧭 Which areas of the business should focus on improvement or promotion to increase profit?

I used Python in Jupyter Notebook to clean, explore, and visualize the data, and present insights that support data-driven decision-making.

⚙️ Tools & Libraries

Python 🐍

Jupyter Notebook

pandas – Data cleaning and manipulation

numpy – Numerical computation

matplotlib & seaborn – Data visualization

plotly – Interactive charts and dashboards

🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation

Removed missing values and duplicates

Converted “Order Date” to datetime format

Created new columns for Month and Year

Grouped and aggregated data for time-based and category-wise analysis

Filtered outliers to ensure reliable insights and visuals

📈 Data Analysis & Key Findings
🗓️ Monthly Sales and Profit

Highest Sales Month: November

Lowest Sales Month: February

Highest Profit Month: December

📊 Insight: Sales and profit peak toward the end of the year, likely due to festive or year-end demand.

🏷️ Category Analysis

Top Category (Sales & Profit): Technology

Lowest Category (Sales): Office Supplies

💡 Insight: Technology drives the highest revenue and profit, while Office Supplies have lower margins and may need strategic focus.

📦 Sub-Category Analysis

Highest Sales Sub-Category: Chairs

Highest Profit Sub-Category: Copiers

🧠 Insight: Copiers and Chairs are key revenue drivers and should be prioritized for marketing and inventory strategies.

👥 Customer Segment Analysis

Most Profitable Segment: Consumer

📈 Insight: The Consumer segment contributes the highest revenue and profit, showing strong B2C performance.

⚖️ Sales-to-Profit Ratio

The company maintains a healthy overall profitability, though certain categories show room for optimization in cost and pricing.

💡 Business Insights

November saw the highest sales, while December delivered the highest profit.

Technology dominates both revenue and profit.

Copiers and Chairs are top-performing sub-categories.

Consumer customers are the most profitable segment.

Office Supplies require pricing or marketing improvements to enhance profit margins.

🎓 What I Learned
